This repository includes the code for the work discussed in the paper titled 'Simulating Quantum Field Theories on Gate-Based Quantum Computers' (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/TQE.2024.3385372), done as part of the Ph. D. research work, under the guidance of Prof. Anil Shaji, in the School of Physics, IISER Thiruvananthapuram.

A method for creating the bosonic creation and annihilation operators for a chosen multiplicity has been included. The Hamiltonian in the light-front coordinates has been created by combining these operators with the fermionic and antifermionic operators, which were already available on Qiskit. It is the simulator run that has been illustrated in the code file. 

The code was written in Qiskit version 0.39.5.
