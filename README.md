This repository includes the code for the work discussed in the paper titled 'Simulating Quantum Field Theories on Gate-Based Quantum Computers' (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/TQE.2024.3385372).

A method for creating the bosonic creation and annihilation operators for a chosen multiplicity has been included. The Hamiltonian in the light-front coordinates has been created by combining these operators with the fermionic and antifermionic operators, which were already available on Qiskit. 

The code was written in Qiskit version 0.39.5.
